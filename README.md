Code of Target pressure and Current pressure P09:
The code that I created initializes a program for an Arduino that to be designed to monitor pressure values from analog sensors and display the target pressure and current pressure on a 4x20 I2C LCD screen. 
Additionally, it includes LEDs that may be used for visual indicators. In fact, the program includes LEDs connected to pins 13, 12, 8, 4, and 7.
These LEDs can serve as visual indicators, possibly representing specific pressure thresholds or triggering events. In summary, the code creates a system for monitoring and displaying pressure information on an LCD screen, providing a tangible interface for understanding pressure conditions. The inclusion of LEDs adds a visual dimension, allowing users to receive additional feedback or alerts based on pressure-related criteria.


C++ code  to initiate code for rocket launcher to perform countdown for Arduin0:
This code simulates a countdown for a rocket launch using an Arduino. It initializes a countdown, prints messages to the serial monitor, and activates a relay pin to simulate the ignition and launch of a rocket. You can customize the code for your specific hardware and add additional logic as needed.
